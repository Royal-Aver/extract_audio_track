With the help of the library moviepy my program cuts the audio track from the video and saves it in a separate file.
I also used Path from library pathlib to save the resulting audio file with the name of the original video file.

To get the desired result, copy the desired video file to the video folder and run the script. The audio file you need will also be placed in the video folder.
